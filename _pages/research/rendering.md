## Toward Efficiency: Neural Rendering

A significant shift is underway in computer graphics, with traditional [rendering pipelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2024/CG-Pipeline/) being reimagined through novel computational architectures. Technologies like [DLSS]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2025/DLSS4/), [FSR]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2022/AMD-FSR/), and PSSR[^PSSR] exemplify this trend, leveraging machine learning to break the long-standing trade-off between rendering cost and visual quality. My current research operates at this frontier, where I architect and integrate novel learning-based components directly into the rendering pipeline. The objective is to significantly boost both efficiency and visual fidelity for demanding applications, including real-time interactive graphics and scalable cloud-based rendering services.
