## Toward Faithfulness: RAW Image Denosing

Noise is a fundamental obstacle in modern imaging systems, degrading visual quality and hampering machine perception tasks. My research confronts this challenge by developing RAW image denoising techniques with a strong emphasis on hardware-friendly design, ensuring solutions are both effective and practical for real-world deployment.

On the other hand, a major bottleneck for the entire research community is the need for costly, per-camera noise profile calibration. To address this, we collected and released a novel benchmark dataset for realistic noise modeling. Based on this benchmark, we are organizing a denoising challenge[^challenge]üèÜ at the AIM workshop[^AIM] in conjunction with ICCV 2025. The goal of this initiative is to spur the development of camera-agnostic noise models. By fostering research that integrates physical priors, we aim to accelerate the creation of generalizable denoising solutions that benefit both academia and industry.
