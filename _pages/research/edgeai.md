## Toward Efficiency: Edge AI

My research focuses on unlocking the full potential of edge computingâ€”delivering applications with lower latency, enhanced privacy, and minimal bandwidth requirements. To achieve this, I am conducting a holistic design philosophy that deeply integrates algorithmic innovations with hardware optimizations.

My current work involves developing ultra-efficient, learning-based models, including my research on [learned LUTs]({{ site.baseurl }}/streaming-&-display/), and deploying them for demanding edge-side applications like real-time RAW image processing and efficient video decoding.

The ultimate goal is to push the boundaries of on-device AI, creating a virtuous cycle where novel algorithms are designed with hardware capabilities in mind, and hardware is inspired by the needs of next-generation models.
