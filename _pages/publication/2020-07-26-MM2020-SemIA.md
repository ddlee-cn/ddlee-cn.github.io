__Semantic Image Analogy__: given a source image $I$ and its segmentation map $P$, along with another
target segmentation map $P'$, synthesizing a new image $I'$ that matches the appearance
of the source image as well as the semantic layout of the target segmentation. The transformations from $P$ to $P'$ and
from $I$ to $I'$ are semantically ``analogous''. 

## Abstract

Recent image-specific Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide a way to learn generative models from a single image instead of a large dataset.
However, the semantic meaning of patches inside a single image is less explored. 
In this work, we first define the task of *Semantic Image Analogy*:
__given a source image and its segmentation map, along with another
target segmentation map, synthesizing a new image that matches the appearance
of the source image as well as the semantic layout of the target segmentation__. 
To accomplish this task, we propose a novel method to model the patch-level correspondence between semantic layout 
and appearance of a single image by training a single-image GAN that takes semantic labels as conditional input.
Once trained, a controllable redistribution of patches from the training image can be obtained
by providing the expected semantic layout as spatial guidance. 
The proposed method contains three essential parts: 
1) a self-supervised training framework, with a progressive data augmentation strategy and an alternating optimization procedure; 
2) a semantic feature translation module that predicts transformation parameters in the image domain from the segmentation domain;
and 3) a semantics-aware patch-wise loss that explicitly measures the similarity of two images in terms of patch distribution. 
Compared with existing solutions, our method generates much more realistic results
given arbitrary semantic labels as conditional input. 

## Framework

![Framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/SemIA/framework.png)

The proposed self-supervised training framework for our conditional GAN. 
At first, augmentation operations are applied on the source image $I_{source}$ and the source segmentation map $P_{source}$ to obtain $I_{aug}$ and $P_{aug}$ as psuedo lables.
Then, the encoder $E_{seg}$ extracts features $F_{source}$ and $F_{aug}$ from $P_{source}$ and $P_{aug}$.
The Semantic Feature Translation (SFT) module predicts transformation parameters $(\gamma_{img}, \beta_{img})$
from $F_{source}$ and $F_{aug}$.
Finally, the generator $G$ maps $I_{source}$ to the fake image $I_{target}$ under the guidance
of $(\gamma_{img}, \beta_{img})$.
At the same time, the discriminator $D$ tries to distinguish $I_{aug}$ and $I_{target}$.
    The auxiliary classifier $S$ predicts the semantic segmentation label $P_{predict}$ of $I_{target}$.
The *Semantic Alignment Loss* between $P_{aug}$ and $P_{predict}$ and 
the *Patch Cohernece Loss* between $I_{source}$ and $I_{target}$ are calculated for self-supervision.
